const questions = [
  {
    q: `1. John Jones is the founder and president of the corporation “ICKY” that hosts chat rooms... Which statement is true with respect to the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination (the Privilege).`,
    options: [
      `ICKY’s Privilege will protect it from producing the records and from Jones having to testify.`,
      `Jones’ Privilege will protect ICKY from producing the records and from having Jones having to testify.`,
      `ICKY’s Privilege will not protect it from producing the records but it will protect Jones from testifying.`,
      `Jones’ Privilege will protect Jones from testifying, but ICKY will have to produce the records because it has no Privilege.`
    ],
    answer: 3,
    explanation: `The Fifth Amendment privilege is personal. Corporations (collective entities) generally have no privilege against self-incrimination, so corporate records can be compelled. Jones may assert his own privilege against compelled testimonial self-incrimination.`
  },
  {
    q: `2. Which choice correctly states the scope of the protection that the Fifth Amendment Privilege against self-incrimination affords?`,
    options: [
      `The Privilege protects artificial entities such as corporations and labor unions from producing records that tend to incriminate high-level executives.`,
      `The Privilege protects people from both government and private party compulsion to communicate incriminating information.`,
      `The Privilege protects people from government compulsion to communicate testimonial evidence that could be used in a criminal prosecution.`,
      `The Privilege protects people and artificial entities from communicating testimonial evidence that could cause harm to themselves or their loved ones.`
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: `The privilege protects a person from government-compelled testimonial communications that could be used in a criminal case (or lead to such evidence).`
  },
  {
    q: `3. Which choice correctly defines “incriminating” information for Fifth Amendment purposes?`,
    options: [
      `Information is incriminating when it could be used by a government or a private party to subject a person to an adverse financial consequence.`,
      `Information is incriminating when it could be used to discipline or terminate a government employee.`,
      `Information is incriminating when it could be used to cause interpersonal unpleasantness.`,
      `Information is incriminating when a government could use it at a criminal trial (or as a link in the chain) and also as an investigative lead.`
    ],
    answer: 3,
    explanation: `“Incriminating” includes statements that could be used directly in a criminal prosecution or furnish links/leads toward evidence in a criminal case.`
  },
  {
    q: `4. Which statement about the Fifth Amendment privilege is true?`,
    options: [
      `A person can successfully assert the Privilege to avoid answering potentially incriminating questions in civil, criminal, administrative, judicial, Congressional, investigatory, adjudicatory proceedings.`,
      `A person can only successfully assert the Privilege while testifying in a criminal proceeding if answers could prove guilt.`,
      `A person can successfully assert the Privilege to avoid answering questions that could be used to terminate employment.`,
      `A person can successfully assert the Privilege in any proceeding if the person believes answers could be used to prosecute any person.`
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: `The privilege can be asserted in many types of proceedings whenever truthful answers could incriminate the witness.`
  },
  {
    q: `5. A criminal defendant’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination prohibits the government from:`,
    options: [
      `Including the defendant’s photo in an array and showing it to an eyewitness without permission.`,
      `Compelling a defendant to testify in an administrative hearing if the statements could also be used against him in a criminal case.`,
      `Requiring the defendant to give a hair sample for crime scene analysis.`,
      `Compelling the defendant’s mother to testify against her son.`
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: `The Fifth Amendment protects against compelled testimonial self-incrimination. It does not block collection of physical evidence (like hair) or identification procedures like photo arrays.`
  },
  {
    q: `6. Parsons is arrested at home, taken to station, detective silently tosses photos of corpse; Parsons says “It was an accident.” No Miranda warnings. Admissible?`,
    options: [
      `Yes, because Parsons did not respond to a question, so Miranda warnings were not necessary.`,
      `Yes, because confronting Parsons with evidence did not render his statement involuntary under the Fifth Amendment.`,
      `No, because the detective did not give Miranda warnings and obtain a valid waiver before interrogating Parsons.`,
      `No, because Parsons did not have a lawyer present when the detective showed the photographs.`
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: `Miranda applies to custodial interrogation, including its functional equivalent (words/actions police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response). The photo tactic fits that, so no warnings/waiver → statement excluded.`
  },
  {
    q: `7. David says “I am pleading the Fifth for Ann” to stop police from taking Ann’s unincorporated business records. David’s claim is:`,
    options: [
      `Valid because the records are protected as a product of Ann’s cognitive processes.`,
      `Valid because Ann’s business is unincorporated, so she can assert her privilege to keep agents from seizing her business records.`,
      `Invalid because neither David nor Ann are in custody.`,
      `Invalid because the privilege is personal—only Ann can invoke it here.`
    ],
    answer: 3,
    explanation: `The privilege is personal and cannot be asserted by someone else on another person’s behalf. (Also, custody is not required to assert the privilege.)`
  },
  {
    q: `8. Which statement correctly describes the Fifth Amendment standard courts use to decide if a statement was voluntary?`,
    options: [
      `Whether totality of circumstances would have overcome the free will of a reasonable person in the officer’s position.`,
      `Whether totality of circumstances would have overcome the free will of a reasonable person in the suspect’s position.`,
      `Whether totality of circumstances apparent to a bystander would have coerced the statement.`,
      `All of the above are true.`
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: `Voluntariness looks to whether police coercion overbore the will of a reasonable person in the suspect’s position under the totality of circumstances.`
  },
  {
    q: `9. Blackburn had counsel appointed at initial appearance. Undercover agent placed in cell block instructed to listen only; overhears confession to another inmate. At trial, statements will be:`,
    options: [
      `Admitted because Blackburn made them voluntarily, without violations of Miranda/Fifth/Sixth rights.`,
      `Admitted because Blackburn was not in custody in the traditional sense.`,
      `Excluded because government violated Miranda/Fifth Amendment rights.`,
      `Excluded because government violated Sixth Amendment rights.`
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: `Miranda is about custodial interrogation by known law enforcement. Passive listening by an undercover agent is not interrogation. Sixth Amendment “deliberate elicitation” generally requires more than mere passive overhearing.`
  },
  {
    q: `10. Ryder invokes Fifth before grand jury. Which is true?`,
    options: [
      `Government cannot compel Ryder to testify unless he agrees to cooperate.`,
      `Ryder has no right to decline to answer questions before the grand jury.`,
      `Government may obtain a court order compelling testimony and granting formal “use” (statutory) immunity.`,
      `If granted use immunity, government is forever barred from prosecuting Ryder for any crimes he testifies about.`
    ],
    answer: 2,
    explanation: `With statutory/use immunity, the government can compel testimony while barring the use (and derivative use) of that compelled testimony against the witness. It does not automatically bar all prosecution.`
  },
  {
    q: `11. Dion interviewed at his office, conversational tone, no Miranda warnings, not arrested. Admissible?`,
    options: [
      `No, because agents knew Dion was a suspect and had to advise Miranda rights.`,
      `Yes, because a reasonable person in Dion’s position would not think he was under formal arrest or arrest-like custody.`,
      `No, because the interview was a Terry stop without Miranda warnings.`,
      `Yes, because the agents did not interrogate him; they asked nicely.`
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: `Miranda warnings are required only for custodial interrogation. This office interview was noncustodial under the circumstances described.`
  },
  {
    q: `12. Larcomb (FEMA employee) ordered to meet supervisor about missing wipes. What are the legal constraints?`,
    options: [
      `Supervisor cannot compel Larcomb to make statements that could be used against Larcomb in a criminal case.`,
      `Supervisor is not bound by the 5th Amendment because not law enforcement.`,
      `Supervisor must read Miranda warnings.`,
      `Larcomb must explain what he knows because he is a government employee.`
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: `Government employers can require employees to answer job-related questions, but if statements are compelled, they generally cannot be used criminally against the employee (Garrity-type protection). Miranda is not the framework here.`
  },
  {
    q: `13. Turner gets Miranda, says she didn’t know items were stolen; then says “I’m in trouble. I don’t know what to do.” Officer: “Do what you want, but we only have a few questions.” Later statements:`,
    options: [
      `Admissible because she was not entitled to Miranda warnings here.`,
      `Admissible because Turner did not unambiguously invoke her rights.`,
      `Inadmissible because officers must presume invocation if suspect expresses doubt.`,
      `Inadmissible because officers cannot take advantage of a suspect concerned about legal situation.`
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: `Invocation of Miranda rights must be clear and unambiguous. Expressing uncertainty is not an invocation, so questioning may continue and statements can be admissible (assuming a valid waiver).`
  },
  {
    q: `14. Which choice accurately describes requirements for a valid Miranda waiver?`,
    options: [
      `Knowing and voluntary but not intelligent.`,
      `Voluntary, intelligent, and knowing.`,
      `Voluntary but not knowing and intelligent.`,
      `Need not be knowing or voluntary, but must be intelligent.`
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: `A Miranda waiver must be voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.`
  },
  {
    q: `15. Traffic stop: officer asks if Frank has been drinking; Frank answers. Later arrested. Trial court will:`,
    options: [
      `Allow the statement because Frank made it voluntarily.`,
      `Allow the statement because the roadside questioning was noncustodial for Miranda purposes.`,
      `Exclude because officer did not give Miranda warnings before questioning Frank.`,
      `Exclude because Frank was under arrest when asked.`
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: `Routine traffic stops are generally treated as noncustodial for Miranda. So no Miranda warnings were required at that moment; the statement can be admissible if voluntary.`
  },
  {
    q: `16. 911 call: Sam threatens neighbors with shotgun. Officer enters with consent, asks “What happened?” Sam responds about neighbors. Statement will be:`,
    options: [
      `Admissible if the court does not find Sam was in custody when he made the statement.`,
      `Admissible because the question fits the public safety exception.`,
      `Inadmissible because Sam could not have made a voluntary statement under these circumstances.`,
      `Inadmissible because officer used rapport to overcome Sam’s will.`
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: `Miranda turns on custody + interrogation. If Sam was not in custody in his home under these facts, Miranda does not bar the statement.`
  },
  {
    q: `17. When is coercion (Fifth Amendment) most likely?`,
    options: [
      `Officers lie about finding fingerprints.`,
      `Officers threaten a single mother that if she doesn’t give a statement they will arrest her and she will lose her job and custody of her children.`,
      `Officers accurately explain that a third trafficking conviction could yield life in prison.`,
      `Officers promise to tell the prosecutor about cooperation.`
    ],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: `Threats tied to children/custody and severe personal consequences can overbear a suspect’s will and are classic coercion indicators under the totality of circumstances.`
  },
  {
    q: `18. Alfred invokes right to remain silent. Later, best friend asks “What happened?” Alfred confesses; officers overhear. Court will:`,
    options: [
      `Admit the statement because the government did not violate Alfred’s rights.`,
      `Admit because Alfred waived counsel by talking to friend.`,
      `Exclude because Alfred did not re-approach police after invoking right to counsel.`,
      `Exclude because no one may question Alfred after invocation without attorney present.`
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: `Miranda restricts custodial interrogation by law enforcement (or their agents). A private friend’s questioning is not police interrogation, so the overheard statement is generally admissible.`
  },
  {
    q: `19. Brad tells investigators at home: “I am invoking my Miranda rights.” They say not arresting him; he invites them in; 2-hour interview; he confesses; later arrested and Mirandized. Confession will be:`,
    options: [
      `Admitted because the government did not compel Brad to incriminate himself (noncustodial interview).`,
      `Admitted because Brad implicitly waived Miranda by inviting them in.`,
      `Excluded because the two-hour interview overcame Brad’s will to resist.`,
      `Excluded because Brad invoked Miranda and investigators did not honor it.`
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: `Miranda applies to custodial interrogation. Brad was interviewed in his home after being told he was not under arrest; if noncustodial, Miranda invocation doesn’t bar questioning and the confession can be admissible if voluntary.`
  },
  {
    q: `20. After Miranda warnings, suspect doesn’t answer waiver question but gives 20-minute incriminating monologue. Admissible?`,
    options: [
      `Yes, because suspect impliedly waived Miranda rights by voluntarily speaking after warnings.`,
      `No, because a written waiver was required.`,
      `No, because the monologue proves mental illness and incapacity to waive.`,
      `No, because waiver must be an express verbal “yes.”`
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: `A waiver can be implied when a suspect receives and understands Miranda warnings and then voluntarily speaks. A written or express verbal waiver is not always required.`
  },
  {
    q: `21. Photo array: victim initially says maybe #2. Officer tells victim to look again and “take a really close look at photo #4.” Victim then picks #4. Identification is:`,
    options: [
      `Tainted because Officer Cameron interfered with the process.`,
      `Tainted because the officer should have used more than six photos.`,
      `Valid because victim was not compelled to select anyone.`,
      `Valid because officer did not say the suspect was in the array.`
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: `Steering the witness toward a particular photo can make the procedure impermissibly suggestive and taint the identification.`
  },
  {
    q: `22. Which choice would create an impermissibly suggestive photo array violating due process?`,
    options: [
      `Five men age 25–30 with facial hair plus suspect photo of man age 60–65 with no facial hair.`,
      `Six images of men age 25–30 with facial hair.`,
      `A show-up of a clown-suit suspect detained minutes later nearby matching description.`,
      `An undercover agent reviews a binder of ~50 photos from surveillance to see if suspect is included.`
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: `If the suspect obviously stands out from fillers (age/appearance mismatch), the array is impermissibly suggestive under due process principles.`
  },
  {
    q: `23. Which choice correctly describes a show-up?`,
    options: [
      `A disfavored, one-person identification ordinarily permitted when close in time and space to the observation.`,
      `An in-person six-suspect identification that is a critical stage requiring Sixth Amendment counsel.`,
      `A photo identification procedure requiring a minimum of six photographs.`,
      `A photographic show-up that must not place suspect second in sequence.`
    ],
    answer: 0,
    explanation: `A show-up is typically a one-person identification procedure, often allowed shortly after the crime near the scene despite being generally disfavored.`
